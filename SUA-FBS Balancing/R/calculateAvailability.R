##' Aggregate Availability
##' 
##' In order to determine shares for standardization, we have to calculate 
##' availability of parent commodities.  For example, if fruit juice is produced
##' from both apples and oranges, and the country has 400 tonnes of apples and 
##' 100 tonnes of oranges, then we should standardize 80% of fruit juice values 
##' to apples and 20% to oranges.  This becomes more complicated when you 
##' consider the multiple levels of the tree, and that there may be trade of 
##' flour, for example, which influences the availability of wheat.
##' 
##' Note that availability becomes complicated with complicated graphs.  For 
##' example, if A is a parent of B and C, and B and C are both parents of D, 
##' what is the availability of A for standardizing D?  There is no clear best 
##' approach, but we decided to compute availability of A for D in this case by 
##' computing the availability of A, B, and C for D (i.e. aggregating the 
##' imbalances over all parents in the path).  In the case of A and B are 
##' parents of C and C is a parent of D, we have a different problem. Imbalances
##' in C shouldn't be double counted in the imbalances of A and B, so we should
##' split C's imbalance into A and B according to availability of A and B.
##' 
##' @param tree The commodity tree, specified as a data.table object.  It should
##'   have columns childVar (the commodity code of the child), parentVar (the 
##'   commodity code of the parent), extractionVar (numeric value specifying the
##'   extraction rate), and possibly shareVar (numeric value specifying how the 
##'   commodity should be split up), all of which are specified in standParams.
##' @param standParams The parameters for standardization.  These parameters 
##'   provide information about the columns of data and tree, specifying (for 
##'   example) which columns should be standardized, which columns represent 
##'   parents/children, etc.
##'   
##' @return A data.table with columns parentVar, childVar, and the availability 
##'   from that process.  Thus, if beer could be standardized into wheat, maize 
##'   or barley (and there is availability in all three products) our final 
##'   table will have three rows (beer/wheat, beer/maize, beer/barley).

##' Map Commodity Tree
##' 
##' This function maps the oldCommodityTree (under one commodity code system)
##' into a new commodity tree.  It does this by first translating all parents
##' and children in the tree to their new elements.  This may create duplicated
##' edges, and in those cases the extraction rates and shares are averaged.
##' 
##' @param oldCommodityTree A data.table containing the edge structure of the
##' commodity tree (specified by parent/child columns) and the extraction
##' rates and shares.  Typically, this is produced from getOldCommodityTree.
##' @param commodityMap A data.table containing the mapping from the old
##' commodity codes to the new commodity codes.  Currently, no other
##' information from this table will be utilized.
##' @param oldColname The column name of commodityMap which contains the IDs
##' for the old commodity codes.
##' @param newColname The column name of commodityMap which contains the IDs
##' for the new commodity codes.
##' @param parentColname The column name of commodityTree which contains the
##' ID for the parent commodity.
##' @param childColname The column name of commodityTree which contains the
##' ID for the child commodity.
##' @param extractionColname The column name of commodityTree which contains the
##' extraction rates.  Extraction rates represent the quantity of the child that
##' can be produced from 1 unit of the parent.  Typically, though, they are
##' expressed in 10,000's: i.e. if the extraction rate is 8000, 1 parent unit
##' can be processed into 1 * 8000/10000 = 0.8 child units.
##' @param shareColname The column name of commodityTree which contains the
##' shares variable.  This value represents the percent of the parent commodity
##' that is processed into the child.  For example, a share value of 50 means
##' that 300 units of the parent would be processed into 300*50/100 = 150 units
##' of the child.
##' @param byKey Character vector of column names of oldCommodityTree which
##' should be used in the by argument when averaging the final extraction
##' rates.  The new parent and child item codes will always be included, but
##' the user may want to include year, country, etc. if the passed commodity
##' tree has those dimensions.
##' 
##' @return A data.table of the new commodity tree.

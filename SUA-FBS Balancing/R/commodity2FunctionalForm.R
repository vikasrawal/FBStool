##' Commodity to Functional Form
##' 
##' This function takes a commodity code and maps the commodity code to a "food 
##' demand model" code and a "food commodity model" code.  These are types of
##' models that were originally implemented by Josef Schmidhuber in SAS, and we
##' are re-using the coefficients in R in the absence of a better food model.
##' 
##' @param commodityCode A character vector of commodity codes.
##'   
##' @return A list with two objects: a vector of the corresponding food demand 
##'   codes and a vector of the corresponding food commodity codes.

##' Adjust Commodity Tree
##' 
##' This function takes a set of commodity trees (typically all countries for
##' one year) and adjusts the extraction rates.  The rationale is that previous
##' extraction rates were manually adjusted, sometimes to extreme values.
##' Thus, we need a consistent way to modify those rates, and the logic for
##' adjusting those rates is contained in this function.
##' 
##' @param commodityTree A data.table containing the edge structure of the
##' commodity tree (specified by parent/child columns) and the extraction
##' rates and shares.  Typically, this is produced from getOldCommodityTree.
##' @param parentColname The column name of commodityTree which contains the
##' ID for the parent commodity.
##' @param childColname The column name of commodityTree which contains the
##' ID for the child commodity.
##' @param extractionColname The column name of commodityTree which contains the
##' extraction rates.  Extraction rates represent the quantity of the child that
##' can be produced from 1 unit of the parent.  Typically, though, they are
##' expressed in 10,000's: i.e. if the extraction rate is 8000, 1 parent unit
##' can be processed into 1 * 8000/10000 = 0.8 child units.
##' @param shareColname The column name of commodityTree which contains the
##' shares variable.  This value represents the percent of the parent commodity
##' that is processed into the child.  For example, a share value of 50 means
##' that 300 units of the parent would be processed into 300*50/100 = 150 units
##' of the child.
##' @param byKey A character vector of column names of commodityTree.
##' We group extraction rates based on averages across groups.
##' The byKey argument provides the column names which should be used as
##' grouping variables for estimating this mean.  Note that parentColname and
##' childColname are always used as grouping variables, as extraction rates are
##' specific to edges.  This defaults to NULL, in which case all values (for
##' the same edge) are averaged.
##' @param nSigma The number of standard deviations away from the mean that
##' is deemed acceptable.  Any extraction rates outside of this range will be
##' updated based on the estimated mean and standard error.  The new extraction
##' rate value will be based on the quantile of the original value.  If the 
##' original value was the largest value in a group of N extraction rates, then
##' the new value will be the (N-0.5)/N*100 percentile of a normal distribution
##' with mean and variance estimated from the data.  If all data should be
##' mapped to the corresponding normal quantile, set nSigma = 0.  To just
##' adjust extreme values, set nSigma to something like 2 or 3.  Note: this
##' mapping may not preserve the original ordering, and it is only guaranteed
##' to do so if nSigma = 0 (all adjusted) or nSigma = Inf (none adjusted).
##' 
##' @return This function returns an object that is the same as the input
##' commodityTree except that extreme extraction rates have been adjusted.
